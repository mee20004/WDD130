            <h2>Client Report</h2>
            <p>As a client, I decided to get a website based on a photo gallery because I thought it would be easy to create. My brother is a photographer, and I got my photos from some of his galleries. I communicated with my developer, giving her any resources she needed, like the logo for the site. Overall, the developers did not reach my expectations for the site. I designed my site using Figma—it was very clear and simple for them to create—but the home page looks nothing like the design, and the other two pages still don’t exist at all. Next time I hire a developer to create a website, I would hire someone who is better at creating websites.</p>

            <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
            <p>As the lead developer, I led my team by emailing them assignments. I also emailed the client requesting content and direction; however, he failed to provide any real content for the site. I published the site through GitHub and emailed the link to the client. GitHub is an amazing tool that made it incredibly easy to publish and update the site.</p>

            <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
            <p>As a junior developer for two projects I communicated to my team leads to get the github project and assignments. I knew that it was expected of me to complete a side page which I chose and completed. I contributed primarily html for the side page structure with little css changes. I never ran into any issues with adding changes through github.</p>

            <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
            <p>The most challenging part for me was creating a site with the worst colors I have ever seen. I overcame this by trying to use the bright, differing colors sparingly and focusing on the gray and red. The part I enjoyed most was doing the HTML; it was nice and easy to put together and was stress-free compared to the design. If I were to do the project again, I would contact the client and encourage him to choose a different color scheme. Overall, I don’t think I necessarily feel more confident in working on real-world projects, but I do feel more confident in my own HTML and CSS skills.</p>
